    "# Hawaiian Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Hawaiian words can be intimidating to attempt to pronounce. Words like\n",
    "humuhumunukunukuapua'a look like someone may have fallen asleep on the keyboard. The\n",
    "language is actually very simple and only contains 12 characters; 5 vowels and 7 consonants.\n",
    "We are going to write a program that allows the user to enter a hawaiian word and give the\n",
    "pronunciation of the word or words as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "●  The program should validate that the word given by the user only has valid Hawaiian\n",
    "characters. Spaces and the apostrophe (‘) are valid as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "●  If a word is not valid, warn the user about offending characters and prompt for a\n",
    "hawaiian word again.\n",
    "\n",
    "●  Spaces are breaks for words and should be kept intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "●  The apostrophe is a hard stop, and should be kept in the word. A word with a’i is\n",
    "pronounced ah’ee. Without the apostrophe it would be eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "●  Ask the user if they want to do another word. Valid responses are Y, YES, N or NO. If\n",
    "they want to play more, then they can enter another hawaiian word. If no, then the\n",
    "program ends."
